# This configuration file may be used by servicemix components to load default
# values when installed.  Note that the values configured here are only
# used at component installation time.  If you want to change these values
# once the component is installed, you need to use a JMX console and connect
# to the configuration for the component.
#
# The syntax is:
#   [component-name].[property] = [value]
# where:
#   [component-name] is the name of the component (defined in the component jbi descriptor)
#   [property] is the name of the property
#   [value] is the value given to the property
