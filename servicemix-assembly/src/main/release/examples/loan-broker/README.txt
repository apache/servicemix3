Welcome to the LoanDemo Example
=============================================

This example is based on the great EIP book (http://www.enterpriseintegrationpatterns.com/ComposedMessagingExample.html).
The client and components are built and run from source using Ant, http://ant.apache.org.

To start the servicemix server using the sample configuration, you must enter the following commands:

ant setup
../../bin/servicemix servicemix.xml

This will start the loan broker component.

A simple JMS client based on lingo (http://lingo.codehaus.org/) is provided.   
Just execute 'ant' from the current directory to run the JMS client.
