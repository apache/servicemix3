Welcome to the wsn-http-binding Example
=============================================

This example shows how to expose a the WS-Notification broker over an http endpoint.
The components are built and run from source using Ant, http://ant.apache.org.

To start the servicemix server using the sample configuration, you must enter the following commands:

ant setup
../../bin/servicemix servicemix.xml

This will start the wsn-http-binding demo.

You can see the exposed service (and its WSDL) browsing at
   http://localhost:8192/
