Welcome to Apache ServiceMix!
======================
Apache ServiceMix is an open source distributed Enterprise Service Bus (ESB) and SOA toolkit built from the ground up 
on the semantics and APIs of the Java Business Integration (JBI) specification JSR 208 and released under 
the Apache 2.0 license.

Apache ServiceMix is lightweight and easily embeddable, has integrated Spring support and can be run at the edge of 
the network (inside a client or server), as a standalone ESB provider or as a service within another ESB. 
You can use ServiceMix in Java SE or a Java EE application server.


Incubation Disclaimer
=====================
Apache ServiceMix is an effort undergoing incubation at the Apache Software Foundation (ASF), sponsored by the Geronimo PMC. 
Incubation is required of all newly accepted projects until a further review indicates that the infrastructure, 
communications, and decision making process have stabilized in a manner consistent with other successful ASF projects. 

While incubation status is not necessarily a reflection of the completeness or stability of the code, it does 
indicate that the project has yet to be fully endorsed by the ASF.
